The goal of our project is to create a web app that helps people to reduce their debt by providing the user with:
Analytics of their expenses and debt payoff time
Provide ways the user can reduce expenses
Most people in the world tend to be in debt and we want to provide a baseline for people looking to pay back their debt.
