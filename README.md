Our project is a website that will ask the user to input data related to their income, expenses, and debt, then use the data to calculate how long it will take to pay off the debt and help the user understand ways to decrease their debt. The goal of our project is to create a website providing features on ways to decrease expenses to help alleviate debt from households. Most people in the world tend to be in debt and what we want to do is provide a baseline for people when looking to pay back their debt.
